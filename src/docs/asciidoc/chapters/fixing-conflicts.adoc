=== Demo

=== When metadata is wrong

* Sometimes metadata of a module is simply _wrong_
** "hard" dependency when it should be optional
** dependency on broken version
** missing dependencies
** ...

=== Component metadata rules

* Allow fixing metadata
* Applied to _all configurations_ (unconditionally true)

=== e.g: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-9300[DeltaSpike container control dependency in Camel CDI should be optional]

```kotlin
include::../../../../demos/conflicts/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/bad-metadata.kt[tags=rule]
```

=== Handling mutually exclusive modules

* A _capability_ describes a feature that is mutually exclusive
* All components provide their GAV as a capability by default

=== The famous logging problem

* Slf4j and is bridging / replacement modules
* `log4j` vs. `slf4j-log4j12` vs. `log4j-over-slf4j`
* And similarly for `java.util.logging`
* And again for `commons-logging`

=== Relocated libraries

* `asm:asm` now known as `org.ow2.asm:asm`
* `junit:junit-dep` and `junit:junit`
* `cglib:cglib-nodep` and `cglib:cglib`

=== Detecting conflicts

```kotlin
include::../../../../demos/conflicts/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/loggers.kt[tags=detect_conflicts]
```

=== Detecting conflicts

```kotlin
include::../../../../demos/conflicts/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/loggers.kt[tags=rules]
```

=== Selecting a module over another one

* Uses _dependency substitution_
* This effectively _replaces_ one module with another

```kotlin
include::../../../../demos/conflicts/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/loggers.kt[tags=preference]
```
