== Conclusion

=== Tools for a complex world

* Real world projects _will_ face dependency conflicts
* Gradle provides tools to _model_ conflicts
** not all conflicts are equal (version, implementation, ...)
** better modeling -> better decisions
* Sometimes a _hammer_ is an acceptable solution

We're adding tooling to cover more cases!

=== Coming next

Focus on publishing and the importance of Gradle Module Metadata

* Publishing components
* Maven and Ivy compatibility
* Published capabilities
* Published alignment
* Feature variants
