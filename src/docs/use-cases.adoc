Transitive dependencies

- I don't need a transitive because I only use part of a library (valid exclude)
- Conflicting logging framework implementation (do not use exclude, but capabilities)


Platforms

- Using Bills-of-Material to share versions (existing BOM example)
- Defining platforms for local projects (multi-project with platform)
- Aligning dependencies (virtual platform, example Jackson)
- Aligning dependencies (local platform)

Dynamic versioning / Locking
- You have dynamic versions (example with open version range)
